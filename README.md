# ML Algos from Scratch
## Timothy W. Dooley, PhD

### Objective 
--------------------
This repo contains work to build the main ML algorithms from scratch. I hope to better understand the most common algorithms in DS use today by building them myself. I set out to do this to simply understand the inner workings, not to improve upon those commonly in use (i.e. in no way do I assume my implementations will touch the efficiency of those found in SciKit-Learn).
<br>
Hopefully these exercises will be of use to others who wish to "look under the hood" of these important algos.
